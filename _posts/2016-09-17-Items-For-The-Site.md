#Items for the Site
This page simply lists items for this site and gets more posts to work with

* Require more posts to learn how they are handled by Jekyll
  * Control how many posts are listed, 'archived', etc.
* Find template for site
  * wrap bootstrap, bootstrapzero, HTML5 UP, Themeforest, etc.
    * Third depth, does this work?  
* Formatting of main content section

Some pretty powerful stuff here
