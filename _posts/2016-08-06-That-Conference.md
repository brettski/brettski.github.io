#That Conference

That Conference is your "Summer Camp for Geeks". Held at the Kalahari Resort in the beautiful Wisconsin Dells, it's your last chance to get away before summer slips away. Spend three days with a thousand of your fellow campers and their families, geeking out on everything from writing some epic code to making paper airplanes.


With [so many sessions to choose from](https://www.thatconference.com/Schedule), your head will eventually start to overheat. Cool off in one of the many nearby pools, because unlike your traditional technology conference, you will be camping at a giant indoor waterpark. Be sure to follow us on twitter and like us out on facebook. Then start practicing your cannonballs.
